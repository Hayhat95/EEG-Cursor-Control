An application for converting real-time synaptic commands using the Emotiv INSIGHT headgear to navigate the cursor on a screen.

## How it works
This application uses a WebSocket server for recording and returning data from Emotiv services and the EEG Channels, communicates using JSON-RPC, and runs using Python.
